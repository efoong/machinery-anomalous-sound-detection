Anomalous sound detection in machinery using neural networks

This repository is created for the final project of my university master degree with University of London. The topic of the project is anomalous sound detection in machinery using dataset released by DCASE 2021 Task 2: Unsupervised Anomalous Sound Detection for Machine Condition Monitoring under Domain Shifted Conditions

The repo included notebooks used for data preprocessing and training purposes. 3 models were selected for this project: Fully connected auto-encoder decoder neural network (AE), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Intepolation Deep Neural Network (IDNN).
